# [Build a Bookmark Manager with Rails and Vue][published url]
## Instructor: [José Mota][instructor url]


A bookmark manager is a great tool for storing and sharing links to web resources. It's a great project for learning Ruby on Rails too—a simple web app, but one that uses the full-stack, from database to interactive JavaScript! 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor José Mota will teach you how to build a custom bookmark manager in Ruby on Rails. You'll create a data model and interface for editing bookmarks, a link shortener, a scraper to get basic information about each linked resource, and even some front-end JavaScript to improve interactivity. You'll also get to create some unusual custom controllers and custom actions.
